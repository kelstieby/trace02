                            cannot wait to get back on the court this fall. </p>

                            Sailing Club. Although I do not sail competively, I am the club's Social Media
                            Chair, and I very much enjoy the social aspects of the club. Pictured here is a

                            Even in the midst of COVID, I managed to get to a drive-in concert
                            of one of my favorite artists Quinn XCII, and am very excited to go to Music Midtown
                            this year in Atlanta.</p>
